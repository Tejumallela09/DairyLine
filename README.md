# DairyLine
**Problem Statement**
The Indian government is taking several steps to enhance the production, sourcing, and marketing of milk and milk products. Create a web application that benefits both farmers and consumers. The Web program can hold the private dairy sector's data, provide an e-platform for marketing their products, a capital manager to arrange their investments and budgets, and information on the most accessible veterinarians in their area to streamline this process.

**Abstract**
In this project, the goal is to develop a web application that will provide a means of connecting the individuals involved in Dairy farms. DairyLine is a direct-to-consumer milk and dairy products interface that sources its products directly from farmers and delivers them to customers' doorsteps, by working directly with farmers.
DairyLine allows farmers to decide the prices for their products, which can help improve their economic stability. Additionally, by eliminating intermediaries, the farmers can have a better idea of the demand for their products and plan their production accordingly.
We provide an authenticated user interface that ensures quality assurance, and a range of products. We notify dairy farmers of the latest government schemes and policies. We provide an e-platform to market their products directly to the customers. Additionally, we provide a capital manager to organize their investments and budgets. Moreover, we inform the farmers of the veterinarians in their locality.  

**Literature Survey**
1. Mowahid Muzaffer Khan and Mubashir Farooq through their journal paper on “A Review on Developing Online Milk/dairy products Delivery System” suggested the need for introducing a web-based interface to order milk and milk products online. They proposed that people feel comfortable ordering dairy products at home rather than going out, especially after the world faced  covid-19.

2. Somasekaran Subash and Jancy Gupta through their research article “Effectiveness of the Interactive Web-Module on Knowledge Empowerment of Dairy Farmers” recommended from the study that, in developing countries, the web module model for agricultural technology transfer has proven to be effective among farmers, and is emerging as a new paradigm in agricultural technology transfer. [Subash S, Gupta J, Gereketi PB (2018). Effectiveness of the interactive web module on knowledge empowerment of dairy farmers. J. Anim. Health] 
3. Pritam Ramteke, and Sandeep Pathak through their research article "Development of Web Based System for Farmer to Consumer Product Selling Through Direct Marketing" proposed a web-based system that will help farmers know more about market information. Farmers can get more profit than any other preexisting program because of the simplicity of the program. This optimized site allows for better communication between the farmer and the customer.[paper id: IJCRT2003308, © 2020 IJCRT | Volume 8, Issue 3 March 2020].
4. In 2016, Prateek Gupta, the founder of DesiFarms, proposed a system for sourcing milk directly from farmers and delivering it within 12-24 hours of milking. Overall, the system acts as an intermediary and fails to connect farmers directly to the customers. [source: https://desifarmsindia.in/aboutus].
5. Country Delight was founded by Chakradhar Gade and Nitin Kaushal, who promise natural, fresh, and unadulterated milk directly to their customers. According to customers, the delivery of milk and milk products was of poor quality and curdled within 24hours. [source:https://www.consumercomplaints.in/bycompany/country-delight-a592237.html]

**Major Objectives**
1.To provide a technology that is aimed at facilitating the interaction between dairy farmers and their customers.
2.To provide access to market information as well as opportunities within the market.
3.To assist clients in purchasing quality milk from local regional dairy farmers in their area.
Minor Objectives
4.To inform customers as accurately as possible about the specifics of their items.
5.To affirm their financial situation swiftly and effectively.
6.To connect farmers to their local veterinary service providers.
7.To promote policies and regulations that support the interests of dairy farmers.

**Project Scope**
Our website acts as a platform to link local dairy farmers with consumers whose top goal is to buy high-quality milk and milk products. We help clients pick the right product for their requirements, and give them the greatest and most trustworthy information. Farmers can build a loyal customer base through the services we provide. Via our capital budgeter, they may swiftly and effectively plan their expenses and income to ascertain their financial situation. There is a geographic limitation to the availability of this service. The possibility of scheduling an appointment with a veterinarian is unavailable through us.

**Existing System**
1.Several platforms, such as Whyte Farms, Desifarms, OSAM, and Milk Mantra, are engaged in developing, acquiring, and marketing their products.
2.The company's self-promotion and advertising focus more on promising the quality of the milk than proving that the assurances are true.
3.On the other hand, other dairy e-commerce sites such as Milkbasket, and Bigbasket, place a great deal of emphasis and advertising on well-known brands, allowing for little or no business from smaller producers in regional areas.
4.While all of the aforementioned sites offer a personalized membership option, they all urge users to remain loyal to them in the long run and discourage them from switching to more useful platforms in the near future.
5.As opposed to focusing equally on the production, procurement, and marketing of cattle products, systems such as Brainwired and Farmbrite offer a comprehensive cattle-oriented service.

**Gap identified**
1.As mentioned earlier, the websites all place a greater emphasis on serving customers than on farmers and therefore provide small growers with minimal opportunities.
2.There is no encouragement given to farmers to develop, manage, and assess the financial impacts of their actions.
3.Currently, local dairy producers have no integrated platform for e-commerce and milk production.

**Limitation**
1.Customers cannot physically see the product, they can only visualize it.
2.Restricted to geographic area.
3.Only literate farmers with sufficient yields will be included in our system.
4.We do not offer the possibility of making an appointment with a veterinarian. 

**Assumptions**
1.We assume that all farmers have the technical knowledge to use the website.
2.Provided that the farmer can produce his own milk and milk products and has his own milk storage
3.Assume that there is at least one veterinarian within a 5 km radius. 
4.Suppose all farmers speak English. 
5.Milk packages are provided by the farmers themselves.
6.Assumes farms are close to metropolitan areas.
7.The premise is that sufficient cattle are available for daily production
8.Assuming the farmer and customer ratio is appropriate.
9.We think that we offer reasonable prices for their products and they make a profit

**Proposed System**
1.The project focuses on the local farmers and provides them with the opportunity to scale and improve their customer base.
2.Farmers can plan their actions and access market resources to improve their financial stability by assessing and utilizing available resources.
3.Our platforms complement their production and marketing, providing them with a united platform to run their business.
